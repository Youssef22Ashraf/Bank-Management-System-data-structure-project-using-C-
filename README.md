#### Description

The project consists of several classes and functions to manage clients, transactions, and system operations within the bank system. Clients can register, log in, view personal information, create transactions, delete transactions, and reset passwords.

#### Code Explanation

The code is organized into several classes:

1. **Transaction**: Represents a bank transaction with attributes such as ID, name, and date. It provides methods to set and get transaction details and print transaction information.

2. **Client**: Represents a bank client with attributes such as name, email, phone, address, ID, and an array of transactions. It provides methods to set and get client details, print client information, add transactions, and remove transactions.

3. **LinkedListNode**: A helper class representing a node in a linked list.

4. **ClientsLinkedList**: Manages a linked list of clients and provides methods to add clients, check if an email exists, and perform client login.

The `mainMenu()` function acts as the main interface for users to interact with the bank system. It presents various options such as login, client registration, password reset, client listing, and client sorting.

#### Optional Description

This bank system project aims to provide a simple yet functional platform for managing clients and transactions. It utilizes classes, functions, and data structures to ensure efficient client management and system operations.
